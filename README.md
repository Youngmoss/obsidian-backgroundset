## Features

- **Add Background folder**: Add individual folder of images to use as background.
- **Set Background**: Choose any image from the folder and set it as the background.(but if you want to choose a specific image,you need delete current background first)
- **Random Background**: Automatically set a random background from the list.
- **Fade Effects**: Smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions for background changes.

## Bug
- If you want to choose a specific image,you need delete current background first.
- You can't choose a folder out of your vault or inside the .*** folder.
